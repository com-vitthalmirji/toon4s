# Maintainers

This project is maintained under `com-vitthalmirji`.

## Current maintainers

- Primary maintainer: @vitthalmirji

## Maintainer responsibilities

- Review pull requests and issues.
- Keep CI green on `main`.
- Cut releases and update changelog notes.
- Keep compatibility docs current for Spark and Scala versions.

## Backup and continuity

- If the primary maintainer is unavailable for more than 14 days, active contributors may request maintainer access through a GitHub issue.
- Small, scoped pull requests with tests are preferred so review can be shared across contributors.
- Use `good first issue` and `help wanted` labels to grow maintainer coverage.
