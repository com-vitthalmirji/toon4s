## Talk abstract template

Title:

`TOON with Apache Spark: measured gains for LLM tabular workloads`

Abstract:

This session shows how TOON encoding is used from Spark DataFrames and Datasets for LLM workloads.  
We walk through one real workload, compare JSON and TOON with measured bytes and token estimates, and show where TOON does not help.  
The talk ends with practical guardrails, compatibility notes, and a reproducible harness from the public repo.
